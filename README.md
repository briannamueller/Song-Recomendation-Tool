# Song Recomendation Tool

Using the Spotify API, I have created the funtion recommend_songs() that allows a user to get song recomendations based on other artists and songs they enjoy.
- Input for the artist argument should be in list format. Ex: ['Justin Bieber, 'Drake', 'Beyonce'...]
- Input for the songs arguments should be a dictionary of tracks and the track artists. Ex: {'thank u, next':'Ariana Grande', 'Watermelon Sugar':'Harry Styles'...}
- The desired number of recomended songs in increments of 20 can be specified with the num_songs argument. The default is 20 songs. 
- The number of artist inputs + the number of song inputs can not exceed 5.
